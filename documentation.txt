Code details:

    If you want to use enemies in your own level you have to create an array named enemies on it where all the enemies are stored

    Ladder and finish classes have their own update methods. The your scene should run them every update

    If you want to use my finish class then your scene should have an endGame() method





Documenting Vee's level here(you can copy paste my system into your own code. Its super conveniet):


    Tiled/Phaser interractions:

        Level should have 4 tile layers and 1 object layer

        tile layers should be called exatctly these:

            ground
            background
            decorations
            danger


        only ground and danger have colision
        danger kills player on colision


        the object layer should be named exatctly

            gameObjects

        All items on it should contain a string "type" property

        type can be one of these:

            "ladder"
            "slime"
            "spawn"
            "coin"
            "finish"


            ladder should  have int len and width parameters

                len is how far down does the ladder extend
                
                width is how close does the player have to be to it (horizontally) to use it (usally 16-20 is a good value)

            slime has to have a int minX and a maxX value

                The slime will move back and forth between minX and maxX.
                     WARNING!!! if the slime cannot reach minX or maxX it WILL GET STUCK!!!

            spawn has no other data

            finish has to have a len and width which signify how close the player has to be to it to end the game(vertically and horizontally)
