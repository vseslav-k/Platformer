Enemies Mechanic. They patrol back and forth and kill the player if he touches them. They die if attacked. Not very smart but ig they are slimes after all

Lava mechanic. If you fall into it you die (EXTRA CREDIT)

Ladder mechanic. If you are on a ladder you can jump infinitely (essentially a double jump) (climb it) (EXTRA CREDIT)

Beating the level gives you all the stats (coins collected, slimes killed, time, times you died)

Ladders, coins, enemies, player spawn point are all placed with object layer in phaser.

4 tile layers: ground, decorations, background, and danger. Only collide with ground and hazards. Danger kills you on collision and respawn you at the start.

An red flag is placed somewhere in the level. When touched, the level is complete.
