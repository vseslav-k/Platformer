# LEVEL VEE

Enemies Mechanic. They patrol back and forth and kill the player if he touches them. They die if attacked. Not very smart but ig they are slimes after all

Lava mechanic. If you fall into it you die

Ladder mechanic. If you are on a ladder you can jump infinitely (climb it)

Beating the level gives you all the stats (coins collected, slimes killed, time, times you died)

Ladders, coins, enemies, player spawn point are all placed with object layer in phaser.

4 tile layers: ground, decorations, background, and hazard. Only collide with ground and hazards. Hazards kill you on collision.
